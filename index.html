              “Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
              I took the one less traveled by,
              And that has made all the difference.”
              ― Robert Frost</h3>

            <h3>Biography</h3><br>
            <p>31 years ago I offered my friend a trade, my labor for the experience of building his house from the dirt up (and room and board). 
               From then on, I added new building skills until I was competent to start my own remodeling business, <b>Extraordinary Spaces</b>.<br></p>
            <p>Alone, and later with my daughter, I took on projects no other contractor could. It was the strange ones;</p><br>
            <ul class= 'built'>
              <li>The serpentine beds raised to accomodate wheelchair gardening, with plastic enclosures, water sources, and lighting,</li>
              <br>
              <li>The year round patio with radiant floor heating, repurposed antique French doors,
              recycled brick and Jagermeister bottle walls, a glass roof, a floor embedded compass rose 
              (my sculpture of brass, LED lights, stained glass)…,</li>
              <br>
              <li>One customer needed a wall that would admit light and air, but not sound.,</li>
              <br>
              <li>Hidden rooms(2), Art galleries, Seismic retrofits, custom cabinetry, under-lit glass sink...</li>
            </ul><br>
        <p>
            The impossible was our niche. Each one utterly unique, I had to break the job down into elements, processes, order of procedure. 
          These skills are clearly valuable in the problem solving aspect of coding..</p>
        <p><br>
          I am accustomed to seeing long and complex projects through to the end.</p>
        <p><br>
            As needed, I would run a crew of up to 8 with skills from novice to journeyman, as well a coordinate subcontractors and inspectors. 
          I am very comfortable working in collaboration.</p>
        <p><br>
          So, why stop building? I have reached an age where the labor of creating in wood or brick, glass or brass is becoming painful, 
          but I have no love of the office/bidding/negotiations parts of contracting. 
          I decided to become a coder 3 years ago, when my daughter got a job right out of PDX Codeguild, 
          my wife was next (working for Salesforce now) So when covid hit, I made the jump.</p>
        <p><br>
          I began my coding education on line, March of 2020 with the Flatiron school intro course. 
          That was the first time I had tried coding since a BASIC class I took in 1980. I like this new stuff better!</p>
        <p>
          On advice, I tried W3 school, and a React tutorial. I got some help from my peeps, but I needed constant answers, and some direction. 
          When l got the chance last fall, I jumped on to PDX Codeguild for their intro to coding bootcamp.</p>
        <p><br>
          It was exactly what I needed! Alex De Michieli taught a great class! Even though, well, <b><i>django</i></b>, 
          I feel confident that I can learn whatever I need to know, like I did with construction, to do whatever task I need to do.
